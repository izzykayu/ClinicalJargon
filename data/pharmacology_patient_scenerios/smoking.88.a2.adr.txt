Patient concerns may be adverse effects, weight gain, cost of medications) .
T.B. would be a candidate for either agent provided she is able to comply with the frequent dosing schedule (one lozenge or piece of gum every 1–2 hours while she is awake).

T.B. smokes her first cigarette of the day immediately after waking in the morning and she smokes approximately 30 cigarettes/day;
this smoking pattern suggests a higher degree of nicotine dependence, and therefore T.B. would benefit from a higher dose of NRT.

T.B. should initiate treatment with the 4-mg strength of either the nicotine lozenge or nicotine gum dosed every 1 to 2 hours while she is awake and tapered accordingly. Nicotine gum and nicotine lozenges comes in 2mg or 4mg, with flavors such as cherry and mint. Nicorette is also sold OTC.
