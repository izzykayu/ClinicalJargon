A 36-year-old Nigerian Hausa man who had undergone an appendicectomy was referred to our neurology unit with tremor at rest and bradykinesia.
The surgery had been uneventful, and our patient had not taken any medication likely to affect the central nervous system for six weeks before his surgery.
His only medication had been the halothane that was used as general anaesthetic for his appendicectomy, along with preoperative medications consisting of 5 mg diazepam injections, 1 mg starting dose of atropine, and 50 mg of pethidine. Postoperatively, he received intravenous ampicillin and cloxacillin at a dose of 1 g every six hours for one week, and 50 mg of tramadol every 12 hours for five days. He has no family history of PD.

A careful neurological evaluation revealed asymmetrical rigidity, affecting the right side more than the left, with hypokinesia and tremor.
Laboratory investigations, including full blood count, electrolytes and urea, and testing for malaria parasite, HIV and syphilis were essentially normal.

Our patient was diagnosed with drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) and started on levodopa/carbidopa (250 mg) daily.
After three days of treatment, the symptoms resolved completely and six weeks after he remained healthy.
