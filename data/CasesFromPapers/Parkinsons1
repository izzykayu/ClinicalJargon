A 29-year-old Nigerian Edo woman, presented with a five-day history of tremor of her fingers and head at rest, with associated drooling of saliva from her mouth.
There was no history of fever, vomiting, headache, dyspeptic symptoms or any other neurological symptoms, although she reported dizziness.
She had not used any drugs in the preceding six weeks except for quinine tablets.
She reported having had amenorrhea for eight weeks, and believing that she was pregnant, she had taken some tablets of quinine to terminate the pregnancy.
She reported having vaginal bleeding five days after ingestion of six tablets of quinine.
She had no family history of PD.
On physical examination, our patient was found to have mask-like facies, and her speech was monotonous and slightly slurred.
She was extremely slow in carrying out all motor activities. Results of neurological examinations were essentially normal except for the presence of cogwheel and global muscular rigidity. Results of blood chemistry and haematological studies were normal, and serum syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing were negative.
Chest radiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were essentially normal.
A pregnancy test was positive and a pelvic ultrasound scan showed a bulky uterus with product of conception.
Based on the clinical signs and symptoms, a diagnosis of drug-induced Parkinsonian syndrome was made.
We started our patient on low-dose levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg tablets twice daily (BID).
After five days of tx, all the symptoms had disappeared.
The pt recovered completely and had no recurrence of symptoms during follow-up of 30 wks after discontinuing tx.
