J.K. is a 67-year-old male who presents to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a 3-day history
of cough and shortness of breath. J.K. is diagnosed with severe sepsis due to pneumonia and is intubated on
admission to the ICU. J.K. is started on broad spectrum IV antibiotics, including piperacillinâ€“tazobactam and
vancomycin. After receiving 6 L of lactated ringers, J.K. remains hypotensive, and a norepinephrine infusion is
initiated to maintain his mean arterial pressure >65 mm Hg. J.K. is placed on enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously
daily and pantoprazole intravenously for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) respectively. On day 3 of his
ICU course, J.K. develops acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to sepsis/hypoperfusion with his serum
creatinine rising from a baseline of 1.1 to 3.4 mg/dL. J.K. has an nasogastric (NG) tube placed for enteral
nutrition. On day 6 of his ICU stay, J.K. develops a severe Clostridium difficile colitis for which oral
vancomycin is initiated.
